#Hello!
======================================
Hey there!

Thanks for evaluating my peer assignment. I have uploaded both R file and tidy data set as txt file to this folder, hope my comments will help your review!

#### Dowload data from data from Human Activity Recognition archive.

#### The git shows:
*run_analysis.R: R code
*tidy_data_set.csv: result data set
*CodeBook.md: comments on R code
*tidydata.txt	

Cheers,
